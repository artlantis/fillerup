If you have a typical website design with multiple columns, unless you know exactly what content will be placed in each column, you'll usually end up with one column extending past the other. Especially with blogs and forums (and other types of pages that allow user-generated content), the main column tends to get extremely long while the other columns have a fixed amount of content no matter how long the page grows.

Fillerup lets you automatically insert more content into your secondary column, until you run out of content or until the columns are no longer mismatched.
